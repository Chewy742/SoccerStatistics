# SoccerStatistics
A repository for personal projects creating data-driven visuals for soccer players, matches, and games.

## Highlights 

### Pass Maps

Pass Maps are fun visuals that display passes from a match onto a graphic representation of a soccer field. Pass maps can be used to analyze how active a player was in possession, the types of passes he tends to make, his completion rate, and more. 

Here's one of Paul Pogba, a French midfielder, during their World Cup win over Croatia in the 2018 World Cup Final.

Within the folder Pass Map Generators, there contains various generators for different types of pass maps (currently there is only one type), as well as a 'Trial' notebook that shows my process of creating the generator. 

Within the folder Python Futbol, there are trials and basic tests for various different visuals - bar charts, scatter plots done with the help of FC Python tutorials tht can be found at https://fcpython.com/
